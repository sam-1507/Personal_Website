            <h3>Project 1 : Online Voting System</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem Statement : </strong><br>
            Traditional voting systems face challenges such as inefficiency, security risks, and logistical issues. Voters often experience long queues, errors, and a lack of transparency, leading to disenfranchisement and fraud. There is a growing need for a secure, accessible, and user-friendly online voting platform that ensures transparency, privacy, and integrity in the voting process.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works : </strong><br>
                Registration: Users sign up with their details (email, password).<br>
                Login: Voters log in securely.<br>
                Vote: They select their choice (like a candidate) on the webpage.<br>
                Submit: The vote is sent and saved securely.<br>
                Confirmation: Voters get a message confirming their vote.<br>
                Results: After voting ends, results are counted and shown.<br>
